Execute and manage implementation of tasks from tasks.md.

This is the fourth step in the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle.

Given the context provided as an argument, do this:

## 1. INITIALIZATION
1. Run `scripts/check-task-prerequisites.sh --json` to get FEATURE_DIR
2. Load FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md and parse:
   - Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
   - Task descriptions
   - Task status (if already marked)
   - Parallel execution markers [P]
3. Use TodoWrite to create/update internal task tracking with statuses:
   - pending: Not started
   - in_progress: Currently working
   - completed: Successfully finished
   - blocked: Has unresolved issues

## 2. TASK EXECUTION STRATEGY
1. **Identify current state**:
   - Check for existing progress markers in tasks.md
   - Skip completed tasks (marked ‚úÖ)
   - Resume from last in_progress task (marked üîÑ)
   - Start with first pending task if fresh start

2. **Execution order**:
   - Always complete Setup tasks first (T001-T00X)
   - Execute test tasks before implementation (TDD approach)
   - Group parallel tasks [P] for batch execution
   - Respect dependency chains

3. **For each task**:
   - Update tasks.md with üîÑ (in progress)
   - Use TodoWrite to mark as in_progress
   - Execute the task using appropriate tools
   - Run verification (tests/build) after each task
   - Update tasks.md with ‚úÖ (completed) or ‚ùå (blocked)
   - Update TodoWrite status accordingly

## 3. PARALLEL EXECUTION
When encountering tasks marked [P]:
1. Collect all consecutive [P] tasks
2. Use Task agent with multiple concurrent executions:
    ```
    Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="Implement [specific task]",model: "")
    ```
3. Wait for all parallel tasks to complete
4. Update all statuses together

## 4. PROGRESS TRACKING
After each task or batch:
1. Update FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md with status markers:
   - ‚úÖ = Completed successfully
   - üîÑ = Currently in progress
   - ‚ùå = Blocked/failed (add error note)
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è = Paused (for resumption later)
   - (blank) = Pending

2. Add timestamp and brief result after each task:
    ```
    T001: ‚úÖ Project setup - [2025-01-08 10:15] Dependencies installed
    T002: üîÑ Create test suite - [2025-01-08 10:20] Working...
    ```


## 5. VERIFICATION POINTS
After completing each logical group:
1. Run test suite: `swift test` or project-specific test command
2. Build project: Use XcodeBuildMCP for iOS or appropriate build tool
3. If failures occur:
   - Mark task as ‚ùå with error details
   - Create new task for fixing the issue
   - Continue with non-dependent tasks if possible

## 6. RESUMPTION HANDLING
When resuming work (context includes partial progress):
1. Re-read tasks.md to identify current state
2. Find tasks marked üîÑ (in progress) or ‚è∏Ô∏è (paused)
3. Assess what was partially completed
4. Continue from that point
5. Re-run verification for completed work if needed

## 7. COMPLETION CRITERIA
Work is complete when:
  - All tasks show ‚úÖ (completed) or documented ‚ùå (blocked with explanation)
  - Full test suite passes
  - Build succeeds without errors
  - Optional: Run on device/simulator for iOS projects

## 8. ERROR RECOVERY
If a task fails:
1. Document the error in tasks.md next to the task
2. Attempt basic fixes (missing imports, typos)
3. If unresolvable:
   - Mark as ‚ùå with clear explanation
   - Create follow-up task if needed
   - Continue with non-dependent tasks
   - Report blocked tasks at end

## 9. FINAL REPORT
Upon completion or pause, provide:
- Summary of completed tasks (count)
- List of blocked tasks with reasons
- Next steps or remaining work
- Command to resume if paused

## EXAMPLE EXECUTION FLOW
1. Read tasks.md ‚Üí Find T001-T003 pending
2. Execute T001 (setup) ‚Üí Update to ‚úÖ
3. See T002-T003 marked [P] ‚Üí Execute in parallel
4. Both complete ‚Üí Update both to ‚úÖ
5. Execute T004 ‚Üí Fails with error
6. Mark T004 as ‚ùå with error note
7. Skip dependent T005, execute independent T006 
8. Save progress and report status

Remember: The goal is efficient, trackable, resumable task execution with clear progress visibility.
