# Feature With Valid UUID

This spec already has a valid UUID and should not be modified during scanning.

## Overview

This represents a modern spec that was created with UUID support from the beginning.

## UUID Information

- **Spec ID**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- **Format**: UUID v4
- **Purpose**: Primary identifier for cross-platform sync

## Requirements

- **REQ-001**: UUID must remain unchanged during scans
- **REQ-002**: All existing metadata must be preserved
- **REQ-003**: Sync operations should use UUID as primary identifier

## Sync Status

This spec is currently synced with remote systems and should maintain its UUID consistency across all platforms.

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Stability Test**: UUID should never change
2. **Priority Test**: UUID should take precedence over issue_number
3. **Consistency Test**: Multiple scans should yield identical results
