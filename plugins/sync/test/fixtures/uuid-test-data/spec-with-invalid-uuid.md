# Feature With Invalid UUID

This spec has an invalid UUID format that should be replaced during migration.

## Overview

This represents a spec that may have been manually edited or corrupted, resulting in an invalid UUID format.

## Current Issues

- **Invalid UUID**: `not-a-valid-uuid-format`
- **Expected Format**: UUID v4 (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
- **Migration Required**: Yes

## Requirements

- **REQ-001**: System must detect invalid UUID format
- **REQ-002**: System must replace with valid UUID
- **REQ-003**: System must preserve other metadata
- **REQ-004**: System must persist corrected UUID to disk

## Expected Migration Behavior

1. Scanner detects invalid UUID format
2. Generates new valid UUID v4
3. Preserves all other frontmatter fields
4. Writes updated content to disk
5. Logs migration action

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Detection Test**: Invalid format should be identified
2. **Replacement Test**: New valid UUID should be generated
3. **Preservation Test**: Other metadata should remain unchanged
4. **Persistence Test**: Changes should be saved to file
