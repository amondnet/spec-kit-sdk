# Feature Specification: Test Feature Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-test`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "this-is-test"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The input "this-is-test" appears to be a placeholder or test phrase rather than a feature description. What specific functionality or user need should this feature address?]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: initial system state], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user action], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected outcome]
2. **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: alternative state], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: different action], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: different outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: boundary conditions not specified]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error scenarios not defined]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: core functionality not specified in "this-is-test"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation requirements unclear]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user interactions not defined]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data requirements not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior requirements unclear]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No data entities can be identified from "this-is-test" - what data does this feature work with?]
